      question: "What inspired Kuvitus?",
      answer:
        "Kuvitus was inspired by Excalidraw. While using Excalidraw to organize my thoughts and goals, I realized the need for a tool that could seamlessly integrate mind mapping with a To-Do list. This led to the creation of Kuvitus, which combines the flexibility of mind mapping with the structured approach of a To-Do list, facilitating better organization and goal completion.",
