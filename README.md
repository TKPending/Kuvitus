## Why Kuvitus?

Kuvitus was inspired by my use of Excalidraw. While brainstorming ideas, I realised the value of integrating such a tool into a To-Do list, combining the freedom of mind mapping with organised task management. This project also provided an opportunity to deepen my experience with interactive web development, helping users seamlessly translate their thoughts into actionable steps.

## Future Development

Kuvitus is a work in progress, with many exciting features planned, including:

- Smoother transitions with animations
- Expanded toolbar with more tool options
- Enhanced drawing canvas for a more pleasant experience
- Keyboard shortcuts to improve efficiency
- Backend implementation for data storage

*Continued development will be based upon, free time and reception to the initial idea*
